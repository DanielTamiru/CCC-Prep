# CCC-Prep
Problems I did in preparation for the 2019 Canadian Computing Competition
Not all of them are completed. Many contain comments about things I've learned by doing the problem, how I would approach the problem differently if I were to do it again, or imply explaining my train of thought
This was my first coding competition and despite it being interrupted by a fire alarm at my school, it was a great experience.
